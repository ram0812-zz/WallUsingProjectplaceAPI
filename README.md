WallUsingProjectplaceAPI
========================

ProjectplaceWall is a Adobe AIR Trial done sometime back. This is the first draft version to bring a desktop experience for Projectplace using its v2 version of the Conversations API. There is some take aways for AIR developers as the app has an "optimized list view" and does not eat so much amount of RAM when IDLE. Beats yammer and hipchat in performance :-)
